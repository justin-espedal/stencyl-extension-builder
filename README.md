# stencyl-extension-builder

Build tool that executes haxe scripts.

Example

To setup seb, pass it the paths to all ".seb" scripts you want it to run.

`seb setup /home/justin/src/polydes /another/path`

(Example script can be found [here](https://github.com/justin-espedal/polydes/blob/master/.seb))

Then just call `seb` to run the scripts.
